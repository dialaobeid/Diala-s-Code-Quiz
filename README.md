# Dialas-Code-Quiz
Project description:

This challenge requires us to to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. The app will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface which should also include the following criteria:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

Created my code with some assistance frm Xpert learning assistant and google.
